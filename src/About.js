        We love picky eaters. We love foodies. We love vegetarians. We love
        health freaks. "Is there any dessert?" We love them too. We love the
        ones who call. We even love the ones who order online. We love them
        all.

            Born with a mission to revolutionize eating habits, we believe
            in providing tiffins in Mumbai that are healthy, homely and
            hygienic. These meals are ideal for people who are too busy to
            cook or don’t wish to compromise on nutrition with restaurant
            food. The menu, at Apna Tiffins, comes in a variety of
            mouth-watering cuisines and nutritional options- a judicious mix
            of carbohydrates and proteins, low calorie content and no
            artificial flavours/preservatives.

            Whether it’s Hakka noodles, Cheese Balls or Gulab Jamun.
            Nutrition doesn’t have to mean bland, boring diets. Ask the
            dietician on board.

          <p className="lead">
            It’s just like you would make it, minus the effort.

          <p className="lead">
            The team at Apna Tiffins ensures that the meals are not only
            healthy but also appealing to the eye and palette. We believe in
            giving surprises and breaking monotony, so our menu changes
            daily and features over 40 dishes that change every day. That
            includes a variety of vegetables, daal, soups, raita, rice,
            rotis, salads, and snack items. These are healthy,
            well-balanced meals cooked in rice bran/olive oil, which provide
            the right amount of protein along with essential vitamins and
            minerals. The same food prepared in canteens or Udupi
            restaurants can be tasty, but is generally oily and big on your
            pocket.
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            Apna Tiffins also offers different meal plans, such as,
            diabetic meal, low/medium calorie meals, and meals for those who
            want to put on weight. This means, you can build your own
            healthy tiffin or choose from 10-12 combo schemes.

            life-changing Garlic Spinach and Chickpea soup.

            Although you would love to have that fulfilling home cooked meal
            you enjoyed back in school days it's difficult to manage
            anything close to that with your busy schedule. What most of us
            end up eating is not really healthy and at times to our horror
            even unhygienic food, nutritious meal has become "out of sight,
            out of mind". It's very important for you to get your daily
            nutrition - too less or too much is equally harmful, what your
            health demands is a well balanced and healthy tiffin service.
